in the HTTP traffic they forward to PacketFence. Most do by default. Then
in this parameter you must specify the IP of the various load balancers.
This will instruct the captive portal to look for client IPs in the
X-Forwarded-For instead of the actual TCP session when it matches an IP
in the list. Format is a comma separated list of IPs. Note: Apache access
